        Hi again! Once again, I am a recent grad with a Bachelors of Science for Computer
        Science. I'm also currently searching for a Software Engineer position or a Technical Product
        Manager role, specifically in the Bellevue/Seattle area or the Tri-Cities area.
        I had an internship as a TPM at Expedia at one point, which was a lot fun. In general I am a
        backend programmer and like I mentioned on my homepage, I'm creating this site just
        to practice some front end skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I fell in love with Computer Science pretty late into my life. In fact I was actually
        dismissive of it because long ago when I was in middle school we had to make create some
        simple website, and for some reason it left a bad taste in my brain. I originally went
        to college to become an Engineer, because why not, in general it's considered a good career.
        While taking an Engineering class one of our assignmnets was to program and robot to
        move about with an Arduino. Once I did that and got the robot to move around correctly,
        I was like I need to change what I'm studying. So I called up my pops and asked if
        he was ok with me switching majors, which he had no problems with and the rest is history.

        Part of my joy with CS extended to teaching it as well.
        When I got a chance to be a TA for the "intro" CS class, it was an ecstaic moment. Although
        somehow I still am stuck looking at students programs because a family friend is now taking
        the same classes I took. Good practice looking through buggy code I guess.
        There's just something amazing about teaching a subject that you truly enjoy. It's also
        pretty awesome, and quite funny, watching students grow their skills in programming. Especially
        when their first language they're learning is C.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a more casual note, I am a fan of pretty much anything automotive. Everything from
        fixing cars/motorcycles to detailing the things too. In fact my dream is to become
        a professional racecar driver, specifically Formula Drift. Honestly everything I am doing,
        from getting a degree in CS to finding a dev position is to achieve my dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also love to play video games and would also like to get into a game development
        position. Currently the games I am playing are Apex Legends and CoD BO4, but Halo 3
        is probably my favorite game ever. Chess is pretty neat too.
